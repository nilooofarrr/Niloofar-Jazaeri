            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p><strong>Adversarially Robust Metric-Based Meta-learning For Few-shot Learning</strong></p>
            <p>Fully trained two metric-based meta-learners and demonstrated the resilience of Prototypical Networks in maintaining a better balance between robustness and accuracy (by 7 %) with lower model complexity compared to MAML.</p>
            <p><strong>Learning Loss Technique for Active Learning on Image Segmentation</strong></p>
            <p>We proposed a new active learning model based on a loss learning technique that reduced the loss by 10 % compared to random sampling. Experiments were conducted on COCO (5,000 images) datasets and the Core DNN architecture was Unet</p>
            <p><strong>Classification of Sound Levels Based on Evoked Responses</strong></p>
            <p>Examining end-to-end learning, inputting raw signals, assessing feature methods for sound level classification based on evoked responses, enhancing efficacy on Uottawa auditory obtained datasets.</p>

            <h2>Publications</h2>
            <p><strong>Medical Image Segmentation using Topological Data Analysis</strong> | IEEE, Jan 1, 2022</p>
            <p>Implemented a new Shape Analysis method using persistent homology Ripser python packages for improving the Nature paper and it was superior in 20% of cases. This method requires no training time and offers clear interpretability.</p>
            <p><strong>Brain tumor classification via convolutional neural network and extreme learning machines</strong> | Elsevier, Nov 1, 2018</p>
            <p>Designed and implemented KernelCNN and ELM networks for feature engineering and classification to improve upon previous studies on T1-weighted MRI brain images. Analyzed approximately 3,000 data samples for the classification of three types of MRI tumors, achieving an accuracy of 93.68%</p>
            <p><strong>Breast cancer diagnosis based on genomic data and extreme learning machine</strong> | Springer, Jan 1, 2020</p>
            <p>In this paper, we adopted a dimension reduction method based on the NMF algorithm. The experimental result showed that it had a promising error rate ( 0) compared with deep neural networks (DNN) ( 2.7) on the DNA methylation NCBI benchmark dataset.</p>
